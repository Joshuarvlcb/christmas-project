        <h3 > <span>1.</span> The elves are building the sleigh that will be carrying all of the presents this year. In order to make sure it's big enough to carry all of the presents, the elves need to know how much volume is taken up by ALL the presents.

        <h3> <span>2.</span> The elves are trying to wrap all of the presents for christmas. There are 2 different teams working together one that is cutting the boxes of paper for wrapping and one that is doing the wrapping. Find the smallest area square of wrapping paper that you can cut for the box to be completely wrapped. (use the ll their gifts and what I mean by square of paper).

        <h3><span>3.</span> The headmaster elf is getting ready to order all of the wrapping paper needed for every wrapping team and he needs to know how much your team needs. The wrapping paper is cut from a giant spool one at a time. It doesnâ€™t matter how tall the paper is, it will always fit the height. Find how much paper you will cut from the giant spool to cover everything with the least amount of waste. (hint: since the height will always fit everything make sure your length you cut is the smallest side.)

        <h3 class="last"><span>4.</span> The elves are putting the finishing touches on the presents, now that the presents are nicely wrapped they all need a bow to make them perfect. The elves will need to find the length around both sides of the present (also known as the perimeter) so there is enough ribbon to make it all the way around. Once they have the right length for the box they need to make sure they add extra for the ribbon equal to the length, width, and height
